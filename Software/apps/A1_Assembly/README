README for MIPS32R1 Demo 1 : Assembly
-------------------------------------

Creator: Grant Ayers (ayers@cs.stanford.edu)

Description
-----------

A minimal program consisting of only a few assembly instructions.
Useful for testing individual instructions and general functional
correctness of the processor.

The default implementation writes the pattern '01010101' to eight
LEDs at MMIO address 0xC0000000 (for SoC implementations which
have LEDs and use this configuration).


Demonstrates
------------

Basic functional correctness of the processor.


Building and Running
--------------------

Edit the Makefile to point to the MIPS toolchain then run 'make'.
Use the bootloader (or other means of initializing your memory)
to send the resulting .bin file to the device.
