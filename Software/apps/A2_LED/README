------------------------------------------------

Creator: Grant Ayers (ayers@cs.stanford.edu)

Description
-----------

This is a "Hello, World!" demo for the DE0-Nano FGPA board.
It moves a single lit LED from left to right on the board at
varying frequencies.


Demonstrates
------------

- Basic functional correctness of the processor and MMIO interfaces.
- Approximately 200 instructions of 35 types. Continuous execution.
- Timer interrupt functionality.
- General CP0 management and exception/interrupt mechanisms.


Building and Running
--------------------

Edit the Makefile to point to the MIPS toolchain then run 'make'.
Use the bootloader (or other means of initializing your memory)
to send the resulting .bin file to the device.
